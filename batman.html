Written by [The D.C.C.U]

FADE IN:

ACT I

INT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

[BRUCE] WAYNE (30s), lean and weathered from years of training, stares out the window at his approaching home. His hands bear calluses from countless hours of combat practice. His eyes hold depths of experience that weren't there eight years ago.

[PILOT] (V.O.)
“Mr. Wayne, we'll be landing at Gotham International in fifteen minutes.”

Bruce nods silently, his jaw set with determination.

EXT. GOTHAM INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - MORNING

The jet touches down. Bruce emerges carrying only a single duffel bag—everything he owns after eight years of wandering.

INT. ROLLS ROYCE - CONTINUOUS

[ALFRED] PENNYWORTH (60s), distinguished and proper, sits behind the wheel. His face lights up as Bruce slides into the passenger seat.

[ALFRED]
“Master Bruce. Welcome home.”

[BRUCE] slight smile
“Hi Alfred.”

They hug briefly. Alfred studies Bruce's face, noting the changes.

[ALFRED]
“You look... different.”

[BRUCE]
“I feel different.”

[ALFRED]
Good different, I hope?

Bruce considers this as they pull away from the airport.


EXT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY

The Rolls Royce winds up the long driveway toward the imposing Gothic mansion. Bruce stares at his childhood home, memories flooding back.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Bruce steps inside, his footsteps echoing in the vast space. Portraits of his parents watch from the walls. He pauses before a family photo—Thomas, Martha, and young Bruce, all smiling.

[ALFRED]
“Nothing's changed, sir. Everything's exactly as you left it.”

[BRUCE]
“That's the problem, Alfred. Nothing's changed. Not here, not in Gotham.”

[ALFRED]
“Perhaps Bruce Waynes return is what Gotham's been waiting for.”

Bruce turns to face him.

[BRUCE]
“Maybe. Or maybe it needs someone else.”

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - LATER

Bruce sits in his father's chair, reading newspaper clippings Alfred has saved. Headlines scream of corruption, violence, and despair: "MAYOR'S AIDE ARRESTED FOR BRIBERY," "GCPD CAPTAIN UNDER INVESTIGATION," "CRIME RATE HITS DECADE HIGH."

[ALFRED]
“The city's gotten worse since you left. Much worse.”

[BRUCE]
“Who's running things now?”

[ALFRED]
“Officially? Mayor Hill and Commissioner Loeb. Unofficially... that's where it gets complicated.”

Alfred pulls out a file folder.

[ALFRED] (CONT'D)
“Roman Sionis. Owns half the legitimate businesses in Gotham. Very successful, very connected, very... clean.”

[BRUCE]
“You don't sound convinced.”

[ALFRED]
“I've lived in this city long enough to know when something smells rotten. Sionis came from nowhere five years ago. Now he's everywhere—construction contracts, city planning committees, police fundraisers.”

Bruce studies a photograph of ROMAN [SIONIS] (30s), impeccably dressed, shaking hands with Mayor Hill.

[BRUCE]
“What about the muscle? Men like Sionis don't get their hands dirty.”

[ALFRED]
“Well I’ve heard rumors. Someone they call Bane. No one's seen his face, but his reputation... it's enough to keep people quiet.”

[BRUCE]
“Bane.”

[ALFRED]
“The stories say he's not entirely... human. Enhanced somehow. Stronger than any man has a right to be.”

Bruce closes the file.

[BRUCE]
“I need to see Wayne Enterprises tomorrow. Eight years is a long time to be away.”

[ALFRED]
“Of course, sir. Though I should warn you—“

[BRUCE]
“What?”

[ALFRED]
“Sionis has been very interested in Wayne Enterprises during your absence. Several board members have... divided loyalties.”

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - BOARDROOM - DAY

Bruce sits at the head of a polished conference table, facing a dozen BOARD MEMBERS. Some welcome him warmly; others seem less pleased by his return.

BOARD MEMBER [THOMPSON] (50s), slick and nervous, shuffles papers unnecessarily.

[THOMPSON]
“Bruce, wonderful to have you back. We've been managing things quite well in your absence.”

[BRUCE] warm and cheery
“I'm sure you have. Walk me through the major contracts.”

BOARD MEMBER [HAYES] (40s), equally uncomfortable, speaks up.

[HAYES]
“Well, we've partnered with Sionis Holdings on several urban development project—“

[BRUCE]
“Sionis Holdings?”

[THOMPSON]
“Roman Sionis. Excellent businessman. Very forward-thinking about Gotham's future.”

Bruce's expression doesn't change, but his eyes sharpen.

[BRUCE]
“What kind of partnerships?”

[HAYES]
“Infrastructure primarily. Water treatment, electrical grid upgrades, waste management—“

[BRUCE]
“Essential services.”

[THOMPSON]
“Yes, exactly. Very lucrative contracts.”

[BRUCE]
“Im gonna need to review all the paperwork. Tonight.”

The board members exchange nervous glances.

[HAYES]
“Of course, though some of the documents are... confidential. Legal restrictions, you understand.”

[BRUCE] with a slight smile
(standing)
“Gentlemen, let me be clear. This is my company. There are no restrictions that apply to me.”

He starts toward the door, then pauses.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D)
“Oh, and effective immediately, all partnerships with Sionis Holdings are under review. No new contracts until I've had time to examine our existing obligations.”

[THOMPSON]
“Bruce, that could be... problematic. We have deadlines—“

[BRUCE]
“Then let’s hope the paperwork checks out.”

Bruce exits, leaving the board members in uncomfortable silence.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

Bruce spreads Wayne Enterprises contracts across his father's desk. His trained eye picks out discrepancies immediately—inflated costs, vague delivery schedules, clauses that give Sionis Holdings unusual access to Wayne resources.

Alfred enters with tea.

[ALFRED]
“Finding what you expected?”

[BRUCE]
“Definitely not. They've been bleeding Wayne Enterprises dry. Roman Sionis has been using our resources to build his empire.”

[ALFRED]
“What will you do?”

[BRUCE]
“First, I need to understand how deep this goes. Then I'm going to stop it.”

[ALFRED]
“Master Bruce, be careful. Men like Sionis don't appreciate interference.”

[BRUCE]
“Good. Neither do I.”

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - EAST END - NIGHT

Bruce, dressed in dark civilian clothes, a trench coat with a hood and a covering for the lower half of his face, moves through the shadows of Gotham's most dangerous neighborhoods. His eight years of training show in every step—silent, purposeful, aware.

He observes a DRUG DEAL in progress, then follows the [DEALER] into an alley.

INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

The [DEALER] counts money when the dark knight steps from the shadows.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“That’s not yours.”

The Dealer spins, pulling a knife.

[DEALER]
“Back off, man. This ain't your concern.”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Yes it is.”

The Dealer lunges. The dark knight disarms him in one fluid motion, using techniques learned from the League of Assassins. The man hits the ground hard.

[DARK KNIGHT] (CONT'D)
“Who's your supplier?”

[DEALER]
“Go to hell.”

The dark knight applies pressure to a nerve cluster. The Dealer gasps in pain.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“I can keep this up longer than you can.”

[DEALER]
“Okay! Okay! Mickey Torrino runs this corner. But he's small time. Real power comes from higher up.”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“How high?”

[DEALER]
“High enough that asking questions gets you dead.”

The dark knight releases him. The Dealer scrambles away into the night.

EXT. GCPD HEADQUARTERS - ROOFTOP - LATER

Bruce waits in the shadows as CAPTAIN JAMES [GORDON] (60s), tired and honest, emerges onto the roof for a cigarette break.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Captain Gordon.”

Gordon spins, hand moving to his weapon.

[GORDON]
“Who's there?”

The dark knight steps into the dim light cast by the rooftop access door.

[GORDON] (CONT'D)
“You're not supposed to be up here.”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“I have information about corruption in your department.”

[GORDON]
“And you are?”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Someone who wants to help.”

[GORDON]
“Why should I trust you?”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Because you're one of the few honest cops left in Gotham. And because we both want the same thing.”

[GORDON]
“Which is?”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“To save this city before it's too late.”

Gordon studies The dark knights, weighing his options.

[GORDON]
“What kind of information?”

Bruce hands him a manila envelope.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Financial records. Payments from shell companies to police accounts. Detective Morrison, Sergeant Burke, Lieutenant Hayes.”

Gordon opens the envelope, his expression darkening as he reviews the documents.

[GORDON]
“Where did you get this?”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Does it matter?”

[GORDON]
“It matters to me.”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“I have resources the GCPD doesn't.”

[GORDON]
“This is enough to start an investigation, but I'll need more than financial records to make charges stick.”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“You'll have more. Soon.”

[GORDON]
“Wait. What's your name?”

But Bruce has already melted back into the shadows, leaving Gordon alone on the rooftop.

The dark knight observes a human trafficking operation from a rooftop. KIDNAPPERS load terrified women into a truck.

He drops silently into the alley below.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Dark Knight moves through the shadows, taking down guards with precise, non-lethal strikes. His martial arts training from around the world flows together seamlessly—Ninjutsu stealth, Krav Maga efficiency, Boxing power.

The last [[GUARD]] draws a gun. The Dark Knight throws a sharp projectile, disarming him, then closes the distance with lightning speed.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Where are the women being taken?”

[GUARD]
“I don't know nothing!”

The Dark Knight's voice drops to a threatening whisper.

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Wrong answer.”

EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

Police cars surround the building as Gordon arrives. The freed women are being treated by paramedics.

[GORDON to a DETECTIVE)
“What happened here?”

[DETECTIVE]
“Anonymous tip led us to the warehouse. Found the women locked in the basement, the kidnappers tied up and unconscious.”

[GORDON]
“Witnesses?”

[DETECTIVE]
“The women said a man in a coat saved them. Described him as some kind of... shadow.”

Gordon looks up at the surrounding rooftops, but sees nothing.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - MORNING

Bruce reads newspaper coverage of the warehouse rescue. Alfred enters with breakfast.

[ALFRED]
“The papers are calling you "The Dark Knight of Gotham."”

[BRUCE]
“Good.”

MONTAGE - THE [DARK KNIGHT]'S WAR

- Bruce dismantles a protection racket, leaving criminals for police

- He infiltrates a drug warehouse, photographing evidence for Gordon

- He stops an armed robbery, disappearing before police arrive

- News reports show crime statistics dropping across the city

INT. [SIONIS] HOLDINGS - OFFICE - DAY

Roman Sionis, impeccably dressed and controlled, reviews reports with his LIEUTENANT.

[LIEUTENANT]
“The shipments from the docks have been delayed again. Third time this month.”

[SIONIS]
“Elaborate.”

[LIEUTENANT]
“Someone's been interfering with our operations. Street level stuff mostly, but it's adding up.”

[SIONIS]
“Someone?”

[LIEUTENANT]
“They're calling him the Dark Knight. Word is he's some kind of vigilante.”

Sionis's expression doesn't change, but his fingers drum once on the desk.

[SIONIS]
“I see. And our police contacts?”

[LIEUTENANT]
“Getting nervous. Gordon's been asking questions, and some of our people are worried about exposure.”

[SIONIS]
“Perhaps it's time to accelerate our timeline.”

[LIEUTENANT]
“Sir?”

[SIONIS]
“Contact Bane. Tell him we need to discuss the final phase.”

INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

Deep underground, [BANE] (40s), massive and imposing, studies blueprints of Wayne Tower. Tubes run from a device on his back to a mask covering the lower half of his face—his venom delivery system.

Sionis, now as the black mask arrives with two bodyguards.

[BLACK MASK]
“We have a problem.”

[BANE] (looking up slowly)
“Explain.”

[BLACK MASK]
“A vigilante. He's been disrupting our street operations.”

[BANE]
“One man?”

[BLACK MASK]
“Apparently a very capable man.”

Bane stands to his full, intimidating height.

[BANE]
“What do you propose?”

[BLACK MASK]
“We move to phase three immediately. Take control of Wayne Enterprises, then use their resources to implement your plan for Gotham's... restructuring.”

[BANE]
“The city isn't ready. My preparations need another month.”

[BLACK MASK]
“We may not have another month. This Dark Knight is methodical. If he traces our operations back to us—“

[BANE]
“Then perhaps it's time he learned what real fear looks like.”

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT

The Dark Knight continues his campaign, but something has changed. Criminals are sharing information, coordinating responses. Some have started wearing crude imitations of his outfit.

INT. ALLEY - NIGHT
Bruce, in his Dark Knight gear, confronts a group of MUGGERS threatening a COUPLE. But when he steps into the light, he realizes one of the muggers is wearing a makeshift version of his outfit.

[FAKE DARK KNIGHT]
“Hey, man, this is our corner!”

[DARK KNIGHT]
“Take off the coat.

[FAKE DARK KNIGHT]
“Make me!”

The fake vigilante lunges clumsily. Bruce sidesteps and drops him with a single blow, but the damage is done. The victims look confused, unsure which "Dark Knight" to trust.

MONTAGE - THE SYMBOL CORRUPTED

- News reports of "Dark Knight" sightings across the city

- Some are heroes, others are criminals using the identity

- Public confidence wavers as the symbol becomes meaningless

- Crime rates begin climbing again

INT. GCPD - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

Gordon sits across from COMMISSIONER [LOEB] (60s), corrupt and arrogant.

[LOEB]
“This vigilante situation is getting out of hand, Gordon.”

[GORDON]
“He's been effective. Crime rates dropped twenty percent in the neighborhoods
where he's active.”

[LOEB]
“And now we have copycat criminals using his methods. The mayor's breathing down my neck.”

[GORDON]
“So what are you saying?”

[LOEB]
“I'm saying it's time to bring him in. Dead or alive.”

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT

Bruce sits in his father's chair, defeated. News reports play on the television showing yet another "Dark Knight" arrested for assault.

Alfred enters, concerned by Bruce's posture.

[ALFRED]
“Master Bruce?”

[BRUCE]
“It's not working Alfred.”

[ALFRED]
“Perhaps the idea simply needs refinement.”

[BRUCE]
“No. Anyone can put on a coat and call themselves the Dark Knight. The mantle has no power if anyone can claim it.”

Bruce turns off the television and sits in silence. Alfred quietly withdraws.

Suddenly, a BAT flies through the open window, circling the room before landing on the mantelpiece. Bruce watches it, and for a moment, his carefully controlled composure cracks. His hand trembles slightly.

After all his training, all his disciplines learned from masters around the world, this simple creature still triggers his primal fear.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D) (whispered)
“Fear!”

The bat takes flight again, disappearing through the window. Bruce stares at the space where it was, his mind racing.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D) (louder)
“Fear itself.”

Alfred returns, having heard Bruce's voice.

[ALFRED]
“Sir?”

[BRUCE] (standing, energized)
“Alfred, where did that bat come from?”

[ALFRED]
“The caves beneath the manor, I'd imagine. There are thousands of them down there.”

[BRUCE]
“Show me.”

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce and Alfred descend into the caves with flashlights. Thousands of bats hang from the ceiling, their eyes reflecting the light like stars.

[BRUCE]
“They're not just living here. They're thriving.”

[ALFRED]
“Master Bruce, what are you thinking?”

[BRUCE]
“I've been approaching this wrong, Alfred. I was trying to be a man they could respect. But criminals don't respect men—they kill men.”

He looks up at the bats.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D)
“I need to be something they can't kill. Something beyond flesh and blood. A symbol.”

[BRUCE]
“What better symbol then my own fear.”

INT. BATCAVE - WEEKS LATER - NIGHT

The cave has been transformed into a high-tech command center. Bruce works with Lucius Fox to design the suit.

[LUCIUS]
“The grey material will give you the illusion of vulnerability while providing maximum protection.”

[BRUCE]
“Good. I want them to think they have a chance.”

[LUCIUS]
“The cowl's white lenses will make you unreadable, inhuman. Combined with the bat silhouette...”

[BRUCE]
“They'll see their nightmares looking back at them.”

Lucius holds up the finished cowl—angular, imposing, unmistakably bat-like.

[LUCIUS]
“It’s not just a suit, it’s psychological warfare.”

INT. BATCAVE - LATER

Bruce stands, only the back of his body is visible, putting on the complete Batman suit for the first time. As each piece goes on, his posture changes, his presence becomes more commanding.

Alfred watches, adjusting the cape's drape.

[ALFRED]
“The cape needs to be adjusted here, Master Bruce—“

Alfred stops and looks at facing bruce, whose back is turned in

[Bruce]
How does it look?”

Alfred takes an involuntary step backward.

[ALFRED]
“Good Lord... what have you become?”

[Bruce]
“What I need to be.”

[ALFRED]
“That's... that's what frightens me, sir. You say that as if Bruce Wayne is the mask, and this... this is who you really are.”

Bruce doesn't respond. He doesn't need to. They both know Alfred is right.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Out for the first time, as a dark silhouette against the night sky. A cape billows in the wind as he surveys his city.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A DRUG OPERATION is in full swing when the lights suddenly go out. In the darkness, SCREAMS while the criminals are systematically taken down.

[THUG 1]
“What was that?”

[THUG 2]
“I can't see nothing!”

A batarang flies through the darkness, striking a gun from someone's hand. Another thug fires blindly, hitting nothing.

A thug is yanked, Another screams and then finally the last criminal is down.

When the lights come back on, all the criminals are terrified, looking in horror, hanging upside-down from the rafters. In the middle of the room over looking them stand’s BATMAN in full view for the first time

EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

Gordon arrives with backup to find the criminals gift-wrapped for arrest.

MONTAGE - THE BATMAN EFFECT

- Criminals across Gotham whisper about the "Batman"
- Crime rates plummet as fear spreads through the underworld
- News reports struggle to describe the new vigilante
- Unlike the Dark Knight, there are no imitators—this symbol can't be copied, and people are too afraid to

INT. [SIONIS] HOLDINGS - OFFICE - DAY

The Black Mask meets with several CORRUPT POLICE OFFICERS and CITY OFFICIALS.

[BLACK MASK]
Gentlemen, we have a situation that requires immediate attention.

[CORRUPT COP 1]
This Batman's got everyone spooked.

[BLACK MASK]
Which is why he must be stopped. His activities are interfering with our business interests.

[CORRUPT OFFICIAl]
What do you want us to do? No one's even seen him clearly.

[BLACK MASK]
That's about to change. I'm calling in our specialist.

INT. ABANDONED SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

Bane trains alone, pressing massive weights while venom flows through his system. His strength is superhuman, his movements controlled and precise.

Sionis arrives.

[BLACK MASK]
We need to discuss Batman.

[BANE] (not stopping his workout)
The vigilante?

[BLACK MASK]
He's becoming more than a vigilante. People are afraid of him, and that’s getting in our way.

Bane sets down the weights and turns his full attention to Sionis.

[BANE]
What do you propose?

[BLACK MASK]
We draw him out. Force a confrontation on our terms.

[BANE]
How?

[BLACK MASK]
We accelerate the Wayne Enterprises takeover. If Batman is as dedicated to protecting Gotham as he appears, he won't be able to ignore such a direct threat to the city's infrastructure.

[BANE]
And if he proves to be more capable than anticipated?

[BLACK MASK]
Then you'll handle him personally.

Bane considers this, a slight smile visible beneath his mask.

[BANE]
It's been too long since I faced a worthy opponent.

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - BOARDROOM - DAY

Bruce faces the board again, but the atmosphere is more hostile than before.

[THOMPSON]
Bruce, you've been away for weeks. The Sionis contracts are time-sensitive.

[BRUCE]
I've reviewed those contracts. They're terminated, effective immediately.

[HAYES]
You can't do that! We have legal obligations—

[BRUCE]
Legal obligations that were entered into without proper authorization during my absence. Every contract requires my signature as majority shareholder.

Thompson and Hayes exchange worried glances.

[THOMPSON]
This will have consequences, Bruce. Mr. Sionis has invested significant resources based on our agreements.

[BRUCE]
Then Mr. Sionis should have ensured those agreements were legitimate.

Bruce stands and heads for the door.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D)
Oh, and gentlemen? Clean out your offices. You're fired.

EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES BUILDING - NIGHT

Batman perches on a nearby rooftop, watching suspicious vehicles surrounding a building. Through his cowl's enhanced vision, he identifies armed men taking positions.

[BATMAN] (into comm)
Alfred, patch me through to Gordon.

INT. GCPD - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon's phone rings.

[GORDON]
Gordon.

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Captain.

[GORDON] (sitting up straight)
I was wondering when you'd call.

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Wayne Enterprises is about to be attacked. You need to get units there now.

[GORDON]
How do you know this?

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Because I'm watching it happen.

EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Batman watches as BLACK MASK'S MEN breach the building. He activates his grappling gun and swings into action.

INT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES - LOBBY - NIGHT

Armed mercenaries move through the building. Batman drops through a skylight, cape billowing around him like wings.

The mercenaries open fire into the dark hallway, not seeing what they’re shooting.
Batman emerges slowly walking out of the darkness

[MERCENARY 1] (fear in his voice)
What is that thing?!

Batman takes down three men in rapid succession, his fighting style a fluid combination of all his martial arts training.

[MERCENARY 2] (into radio)
We need backup! It’s him!

Batman appears behind him, silent as a ghost.

EXT. WAYNE ENTERPRISES BUILDING - LATER

Police cars arrive and Batman finishes securing the last of the mercenaries. Gordon enters the building to find the criminals unconscious and bound.

[GORDON] (looking around)
Batman?

Batman drops from the shadows above.

[BATMAN]
They’re all mercenaries. Professional grade equipment, military training.

[GORDON]
Who hired them?

[BATMAN]
That's what we need to find out.

Batman hands Gordon a device taken from one of the mercenaries.

[BATMAN] (CONT'D)


Encrypted communicator. Your tech people might be able to trace the signal.

[GORDON]
We’ll get right on it

INT. BATCAVE - LATER

Bruce analyzes evidence from the attack while Alfred tends to minor injuries.

[ALFRED]
The mercenaries were well-trained? By the look of these injuries they had military precision.

[BRUCE]
But they were sloppy with operational security. They left us a trail.

Bruce pulls up financial records on his computer.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D)
Shell companies, numbered accounts... but it all leads back to the same place.

[ALFRED]
Sionis holdings

INT. [SIONIS] HOLDINGS - OFFICE - NIGHT

Sionis paces angrily while speaking on the phone.

[BLACK MASK]
What do you mean "neutralized"? They were professionals!

He slams the phone down and turns to find BATMAN standing in the shadows of his office.

[BLACK MASK] (CONT'D)
Impossible. This building has the best security in Gotham.

[BATMAN]
Not good enough.

Batman steps into the light, and Black Mask gets his first clear look at the terrifying figure.

[BLACK MASK]
The Batman.

[BATMAN]
Black Mask. Or should i say Roman Sionis?

[SIONIS]
I don't know what you're talking about.

Batman throws a batarang that pins a photograph to the wall—Sionis wearing a black skull mask, meeting with known criminals.

[BATMAN]
What about now?

[BLACK MASK]
What do you want?

[BATMAN]
Your criminal empire ends tonight.

[BLACK MASK]
You think you can just walk in here and threaten me? Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

[BATMAN]
Sure i do. You’re a coward, who hides behind others. But not anymore.

BLACK MASK reaches for a panic button, but Batman's batarang destroys it before he can press it.

[BATMAN] (CONT'D)
Your mercenaries, your corrupt cops, your dirty politicians—they're all finished. And now so are you.

[BLACK MASK]
You're making a mistake, Batman. I'm not the real threat to this city.

[BATMAN]
Then who is?

[SIONIS]
Im sure you’ve heard of him by now. And when he's finished with Gotham, there won't be a city left to save.

Batman's eyes narrow behind his cowl.

[BATMAN]
Bane. Where is he?

[BLACK MASK]
If I told you, it wouldn't matter. You're not ready for what's coming.

The office windows suddenly EXPLODE inward as BANE crashes through, venom coursing through his system, making him impossibly strong.

[BANE]
Batman.

The two titans face each other for the first time.

[BANE]
I've been looking forward to this.

Bane lunges with superhuman speed. Batman dodges, but Bane's fist crushes the wall where Batman's head was a second before.

[BATMAN] (into comm)
I need an exit strategy. Now.

Batman throws smoke pellets, filling the office with dense fog, and escapes through the broken window using his grappling gun.

Bane doesn't pursue. He turns to Black Mask.

[BANE]
You failed to contain the situation.

[BLACK MASK]
Bane, listen to me. We can still work together—

[BANE]
No. You've become a liability.

Bane grabs Black Mask by the throat.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
Your methods were always too... subtle for my taste.

[BLACK MASK] (choking)
The plan... Wayne Enterprises...

[BANE](CONT'D)
Don’t worry, ill take care of it, I no longer need your vision. I have my own.

The Black Mask falls lifeless to the floor.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
(to himself)
Now the real work begins.

INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

Bruce analyzes the encounter, his cowl removed, revealing a cut on his forehead. Alfred applies antiseptic.

[ALFRED]
You're lucky to be alive, Master Bruce.

[BRUCE]
Bane's strength isn't just physical conditioning. He's enhanced somehow.

[ALFRED]
Enhanced how?

[BRUCE]
The mask he wears—it's connected to tubes running to his back. Some kind of delivery system.

[ALFRED]
Drugs?

[BRUCE]
Performance enhancers. Venom, most likely. It would explain his superhuman strength and aggression.

Bruce pulls up chemical formulas on his computer.

[BRUCE] (CONT'D)
The question is, what does he want with Gotham?

[ALFRED]
Perhaps the answer lies in what Sionis was planning.

Bruce accesses Wayne Enterprises' security feeds from the night of the attack.

[BRUCE]
They weren't trying to steal anything. They were planting something.

The screen shows mercenaries installing devices throughout the building's infrastructure.

[ALFRED]
Explosives?

[BRUCE]
Worse. Control systems. If Bane can access Wayne Enterprises' network, he can control half of Gotham's infrastructure—power grid, water treatment, communications.

[ALFRED]
The city would be completely at his mercy.

[BRUCE]
We need to evacuate the building and sweep for—

Alarms suddenly blare throughout the cave. On the main screen, Wayne Tower's lights flicker and die.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT

Across the city, power grids fail in sequence. Traffic lights go dark, causing chaos. Water pressure drops to nothing. Cell towers go offline.

INT. GCPD - CONTINUOUS

Emergency lighting kicks in as the building loses power. Gordon rushes to the windows to see the city going dark block by block.

[GORDON] (to officers)
Get me the commissioner! And someone find out what the hell is happening!

His phone rings—one of the few still working.

[GORDON] (CONT'D)
Gordon.

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Captain. The city's under attack.

[GORDON] sarcastically
Yea i noticed, Where are you?

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Wayne Tower. Bane's taken control of the building and he's using it to cripple Gotham's infrastructure.

[GORDON]
Well what do you need?

[BATMAN] (V.O.)
Evacuate a six-block radius around Wayne Tower. Whatever Bane's planning, it's going to be catastrophic.

INT. WAYNE TOWER - LOBBY - NIGHT

Bane stands in the center of the darkened lobby, surrounded by high-tech equipment and armed mercenaries. Venom flows steadily through his mask as he monitors multiple screens showing Gotham's failing systems.

[BANE] (to his lieutenant)
Phase one is complete. Begin phase two.

[LIEUTENANT]
What about the police response?

[BANE]
How are they gonna stop what they can’t see coming.

Bane activates a control panel. On the screens, we see Wayne Enterprises' manufacturing facilities across the city beginning automated production sequences.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
For too long, Gotham has been a symbol of corruption disguised as civilization. Tonight, we tear away that disguise.

EXT. WAYNE TOWER - NIGHT

Batman perches on a nearby rooftop, studying the building through his cowl's enhanced vision. He can see Bane's men at every entrance, heavily armed and professionally positioned.

[BATMAN] (into comm)
Alfred, I need building schematics and alternative entry points.

[ALFRED] (V.O.)
Master Bruce, the structural integrity scans show Bane's made significant modifications to the building's support systems.

[BATMAN]
What kind of modifications?

[ALFRED] (V.O.)
If I'm reading this correctly, he's turned Wayne Tower into a massive bomb.

INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS
Alfred's fingers fly across multiple keyboards, his face pale with realization.

[ALFRED]
The manufacturing equipment he's activated—it's not producing components. It's producing an aerosol delivery system for a chemical weapon.

[BRUCE] (V.O.)
What kind of chemical?

[ALFRED]
Based on the molecular composition... it appears to be a weaponized version of his venom compound. Dispersed through the air, it would drive the entire population into homicidal rage.

EXT. WAYNE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Batman's jaw tightens behind his cowl.

[BATMAN]
How long do I have?

[ALFRED] (V.O.)
The production cycle will be complete in forty-three minutes. After that, the aerosol system will activate automatically.

[BATMAN]
Then I'd better move fast.

Batman fires his grappling gun and swings toward the tower.
INT. WAYNE TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Batman moves through the building taking down Bane's mercenaries. His tactics are more brutal now—the stakes are too high for restraint.

A mercenary rounds the corner and finds his companion unconscious, hanging upside-down.

[MERCENARY] (into radio)
Sector seven is compromised. The Batman's in the building.

[BANE] (V.O.)
Ok then, let him. Cause t's time we finished what we started.

INT. WAYNE TOWER - EXECUTIVE FLOOR - NIGHT

Batman emerges from the elevator shaft to find the floor transformed into a command center. Screens show the venom production reaching 67% completion.

Bane stands with his back to Batman, studying a holographic display of Gotham.

[BANE]
You're earlier than I expected.

[BATMAN]
It ends here, Bane.

[BANE] (turning slowly)
Does it? Look around you, Batman. This building, this city, this entire civilization—it's all an illusion. Beneath the surface, we're all animals.

[BATMAN]
You're wrong.

[BANE]
Am I? You literally dress like a bat and terrorize criminals. How are you any different from me?

[BATMAN]
I protect the innocent.

[BANE]
By becoming what they fear most. We are more alike than you care to admit.

Bane's venom dosage increases, his muscles swelling visibly.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
But there is one crucial difference between us.

[BATMAN]
Which is?

[BANE]
I embrace what I am.

Bane charges with inhuman speed. Batman barely dodges as Bane's fist shatters a concrete pillar.

INT. WAYNE TOWER - VARIOUS FLOORS - NIGHT

The battle rages through multiple levels of the building. Bane's venom-enhanced strength makes him nearly unstoppable, but Batman uses his superior tactics and the environment to stay ahead.

Batman leads Bane into the building's main server room.

[BATMAN]
Alfred, now!

[ALFRED] (V.O.)
Initiating electromagnetic pulse.

The room fills with electrical energy as every computer system in the building shuts down simultaneously.

[BANE]
Clever. But you've only delayed the inevitable.

Bane grabs a server rack and hurls it at Batman, who barely rolls away in time.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
The production systems have backup power. In twenty minutes, this city dies.

[BATMAN]
Not if I stop you first.

Bane lunges again, but this time Batman is ready. He activates an explosive charge, bringing down part of the ceiling between them.

INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS

Alfred monitors the situation from multiple screens, his hands shaking as he informs Batman.

[BATMAN] (into comm)
Captain , the building's structural integrity is failing. You need to evacuate everyone within a ten-block radius.

[GORDON] (V.O.]
We're doing our best, but people are panicking. Half the city's without power.

[BATMAN]
Im containing the threat, but if that building comes down...

[GORDON] (V.O.)
How long do we have?

Alfred checks the venom production counter: 89% complete.

[ALFRED] (V.O] to Batman
It’s already 89% master wayne

[BATMAN] (V.O) to Gordon
Fifteen minutes.

INT. WAYNE TOWER - MANUFACTURING FLOOR - NIGHT

Batman fights his way to the main production facility, where big machines churn out venom-based aerosol canisters. The air is thick with chemical vapors.

Bane appears behind him, having torn through the debris from their previous battle.

[BANE]
You still don't understand, do you? This isn't about destroying Gotham. It's about revealing its true nature.

Batman throws a series of batarangs, but Bane deflects them effortlessly.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
When my venom fills the air, every person in this city will become what they really are underneath their civilized facade.

[BATMAN]
You'll kill millions of innocent people.

[BANE]
Innocent? There are no innocent people in Gotham. Only those who haven't yet shown their true colors.

Bane grabs Batman by the throat and lifts him off the ground.

[BANE] (CONT'D)
But you already know this, don't you? It's why you became Batman. Because deep down, you know that justice requires fear.

Batman activates a sonic device in his gauntlet, disrupting Bane's venom delivery system. The villain staggers, temporarily weakened.

[BATMAN]
You're right about one thing. Justice does require fear.

Batman breaks free and delivers a devastating combination of strikes.

[BATMAN] (CONT'D)
But not the fear of chaos. The fear of consequences.

INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS

Alfred watches the venom production counter: 96% complete.

[ALFRED] (into comm)
Master Bruce, you have four minutes before the aerosol system activates.

[BATMAN] (V.O.) (breathing heavily)
Working on it.

Alfred pulls up building schematics and notices something.

[ALFRED]
The primary production controls are in the penthouse level. If you can reach the main console—

[BATMAN] (V.O.)


I think i see it.

INT. WAYNE TOWER - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Batman bursts through the penthouse doors to find a control system overlooking the city. The venom production counter shows 98% complete.

Bane appears in the doorway behind him, his venom system fully restored.

[BANE]
You cannot stop destiny, Batman.

[BATMAN]
Watch me.

Batman lunges for the control console, but Bane intercepts him, grabbing Batman's cape and hurling him across the room.

[BANE]
Im going to take this city down and rebuild, and you’re going with it.

The two engage in brutal hand-to-hand combat as the counter reaches 99%.

Batman manages to land a solid hit on Bane's venom delivery system, causing it to malfunction. Venom begins leaking from the tubes.

[BANE] (CONT'D (growing weaker)
What have you done?

[BATMAN]
What I should have done from the beginning.

With Bane weakened, Batman fights his way to the control console as the counter hits 100%.

Klaxons begin wailing throughout the building as the aerosol system prepares to activate.

[BATMAN] (CONT'D) (into comm)I need the shutdown sequence!

[ALFRED] (V.O.)
Emergency protocol Omega-Seven-Seven-Alpha!

Batman's fingers fly across the controls, entering the sequence as aerosol vents begin opening throughout the city.

With seconds to spare, he hits the final key.

The system shuts down. The vents close. The city is saved.

[BANE] (collapsing)
You... you have no idea what you've done...

[BATMAN]
I saved Gotham.

[BANE]
You've preserved its corruption. Its doomed.

[BATMAN]
No. I've given it a chance to become something better.

Batman secures Bane with reinforced restraints as police sirens approach the building.

EXT. WAYNE TOWER - DAWN

Gordon arrives with backup as Batman emerges from the building, carrying the unconscious Bane.

[GORDON]
Is it over?

[BATMAN]
For now.

Batman sets Bane down as paramedics rush forward.

[GORDON]
What was he trying to do?

[BATMAN]
Prove that being civil is just a mask we wear. That underneath, we're all monsters.

[GORDON]
And what do you think?

Batman looks out over the city as the sun rises, revealing people helping each other in the aftermath of the power outage.

[BATMAN]
I think he was wrong.

INT. GCPD - COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE - DAY

Gordon sits behind the commissioner's desk—Loeb was arrested for corruption following Batman's investigation. The nameplate reads "COMMISSIONER [GORDON]."

Batman stands in the shadows by the window.

[GORDON]
The mayor wants to give you a medal.

[BATMAN]
I'll pass.

[GORDON]
I figured you would. So what happens now?

[BATMAN]
Now we rebuild. Clean up the corruption. Make sure something like this never happens again.

[GORDON]
It probably will. What about you? Will we see you again?

[BATMAN]
When Gotham needs me.

Batman moves toward the window.

[GORDON]
Batman.

He turns back.

[BATMAN]
Dont. Im always here

Batman disappears into the shadows.

INT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY

Bruce sits in his father's chair, reading newspaper headlines: "[BATMAN] SAVES GOTHAM," "CORRUPTION SCANDAL ROCKS CITY HALL," "HERO OR VIGILANTE?"

Alfred enters with tea and the morning mail.

[ALFRED]
The new board is eager for the work to be done at Wayne Enterprises.

[BRUCE]
Good. We have a lot of to do.

[ALFRED]
And the other work? The night work?

[BRUCE]
Gotham will always need Batman, Alfred. The question is whether Bruce Wayne is also needed.

[ALFRED]
Is he?

Bruce considers this, then looks at a framed photo of his parents.

[BRUCE]
I think he is.

[BATMAN]
But Batman is needed more. My parents died because Gotham was a city without hope. I became Batman to give it protection but not as myself. Not as a man, because men can fail. Not an ideal, because ideals can be corrupted. I became a promise that justice and vengeance will find those who prey on the innocent.

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - NIGHT

Batman emerges from the Batcave's hidden exit, driving the prototype Batmobile through the city streets. His destination: a warehouse where new criminal activity has been reported.

INT. CRIMINAL WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A group of THUGS divide stolen goods when the lights suddenly go out.

[THUG 1]
What the—

A batarang strikes the main fuse box, plunging the warehouse into total darkness.

[THUG 2]
It's him! It's the Batman!

Chaos erupts as Batman moves through the shadows, systematically taking down each criminal with precise, non-lethal force.

[BATMAN] (Voice over)
Justice is patient. But it always comes.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - LATER

Newly elected commissioner gordon arrives to find the criminals tied up.

Gordon looks up at the surrounding rooftops, but sees only shadows.
A slight wind rustles through the alley, and Gordon could swear he sees the flutter of a cape in the darkness.

INT. BATCAVE - LATE NIGHT

Batman returns to the cave, his work for the night complete. He stands before the memorial case containing his parents' belongings—his father's stethoscope, his mother's pearls.

[BATMAN] (Voice over)
The night is full of mysteries. And Batman will be there to solve them.

He walks deeper into the cave, disappearing into the shadows as the camera pulls back to show the vast underground complex—a monument to justice, built from tragedy and forged in determination.

FADE TO BLACK.

THE END

---
POST CREDIT SCENE

EXT. GOTHAM CITY - ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

Batman stands alone on a cathedral spire, but unlike his usual patrol stance, he's perfectly still—waiting. His cape hangs motionless in the calm night air as he stares up at the star-filled sky with focused anticipation.

He checks a device on his gauntlet—some kind of tracking or monitoring equipment—then looks back up.

[BATMAN]
(whispered to himself)
Right on schedule.

A distant WHOOSHING sound cuts through the night air. Batman's white lenses narrow as he spots movement against the stars.

A figure flies overhead—unmistakably humanoid, moving through the air without any visible means of propulsion. A distinctive red cape flows behind the silhouette as it glides silently over Gotham's skyline.

Batman remains perfectly motionless, hidden in shadow against the cathedral's gothic architecture. The flying figure passes directly overhead, completely unaware of the Dark Knight's presence below.
