            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                After eight years of training around the world, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham City to find it overrun with corruption. Legitimate businessman Roman Sionis has infiltrated the city's power structures through his company Sionis Holdings, while rumors circulate about an enhanced enforcer called Bane.

            <p>
                Wayne initially becomes a vigilante called "The Dark Knight," but his efforts prove ineffective when criminals begin using copycat versions of his identity. After a bat flies into Wayne Manor, triggering his childhood fear, Wayne realizes he must become something beyond humanâ€”a symbol that cannot be copied or killed. He transforms the caves beneath his estate into a command center and becomes the Batman, using advanced technology and psychological warfare.

            <p>
                As Batman dismantles Gotham's criminal networks, Sionis accelerates his plans with Bane to take control of Wayne Enterprises. When Batman confronts Sionis at his headquarters, Bane reveals himself as the true mastermind. Enhanced by a venom delivery system, Bane kills Sionis and seizes Wayne Tower, converting the building's manufacturing systems to produce a weaponized aerosol version of his venom compound that would drive Gotham's population into homicidal rage.

                Batman infiltrates Wayne Tower as Bane's plan nears completion. The two battle across multiple floors of the building while Batman races to reach the control systems. Despite Bane's superhuman strength, Batman damages his venom delivery system and reaches the shutdown controls with seconds to spare, preventing the chemical weapon from being released across the city.

                In the aftermath, corrupt Commissioner Loeb is arrested and replaced by the honest Captain Gordon. Batman establishes himself as Gotham's protector while Bruce Wayne rebuilds Wayne Enterprises with a new clean board of directors.
